Is just a silver-waffle repository 

This work is about a login site. Im building a website with php, html5, css3 and javascript, 
therefore mysql is required if you want run it, and by the way, at this momment the site just save nickname and hash_passwords,
so it will remain in develop for a bit.

PD: The table on mysql is made with 3 columns: id(incremented not null), nick and pass.
